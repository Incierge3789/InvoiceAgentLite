Add a self-serve “Google Sheets connection” to InvoiceAgent Lite:

1) Dependencies
- Ensure `gspread` and `google-auth` are installed.

2) Config persistence
- Create `data/` if not exists and add `.gitignore` entry to exclude `data/`.
- Read settings in this priority:
  A) data/config.json (keys: service_account_json, sheet_id, sheet_name)
  B) env vars: GSPREAD_CREDENTIALS_JSON, SHEET_ID, SHEET_NAME
- Add helper:
  - load_config(): returns dict merged from A/B
  - get_worksheet(): build Credentials.from_service_account_info(json.loads(service_account_json)), open_by_key(sheet_id), worksheet(sheet_name)

3) Save-to-Sheets
- Implement save_row_to_sheet(payload) that appends 13 columns:
  [timestamp_utc_iso, file, vendor, date, amount, "JPY", "", "", "", confidence, needs_review, raw_excerpt[:500], "upload"]
- In upload handler: after extraction, if config is present, call save_row_to_sheet(payload). If not present, skip silently and include `"sheet_status": "not_connected"` in JSON.

4) Settings UI (/settings)
- Dark theme page with a simple form:
  - Textarea: “Service Account JSON”
  - Input: “Sheet ID”
  - Input: “Sheet Name” (default: invoices)
  - Buttons: [Save & Test], [Clear]
- POST /settings: write data/config.json (create file if not exists), then run a quick test: open sheet and append a tiny test row `[“invoiceagent:test”, now]` (and delete it immediately), return {ok:true} or error message.
- GET /settings returns current connection status (connected/not connected).

5) CSV fallback
- On the result screen, if Sheets not connected, show a “Download CSV” button that streams a one-line CSV of the just-processed payload with the same 13 columns.

6) Security/UX
- Add `.gitignore` entry for `data/` folder.
- Do not log service_account_json.
- Keep all existing endpoints and FastAPI/Flask framework unchanged.
- Provide a short README section "How to connect your Google Sheets" with 3 steps for buyers.

Finally, test end-to-end:
- Visit /settings, paste a real service account JSON, sheet id, name → Save & Test should return ok.
- Upload a PDF and confirm a new row is added to the sheet. Paste the console/log snippet of the success.
